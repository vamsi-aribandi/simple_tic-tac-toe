# simple_tic-tac-toe
A simple, two player GUI implementation of tic-tac-toe using C and SDL 2. Originally created as my CS50x 2016 final project.

## to compile and play:
run: `make tic-tac-toe` and then `./tic-tac-toe`, (SDL and clang need to be installed).

## useful sources:
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org)
* [CS50 seminar video](https://youtu.be/yFLa3ln16w0)
